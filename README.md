# Hello, I'm Anthony!

I’m a Software Engineering Resident @ Headstarter, where I’m building innovative projects in AI/ML and full-stack development.

My passion lies in transforming creative ideas into real-world applications, utilizing my skills in React, Python, and machine learning. 

When I’m not coding, I’m either immersed in lofi beats or enjoying my time swimming.
