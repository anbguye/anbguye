# Hello, I'm Anthony!

I'm an Incoming Software Developer Intern @ Alpine with experience in AI/ML and full-stack development. 

I work with Python, React, and Machine Learning to build scalable applications and solve real-world problems.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy swimming and listening to lofi music.
