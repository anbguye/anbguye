# Hello, I'm Anthony!

I am currently a resident at Headstarter, where I'm building innovative projects across AI/ML and full-stack development. 

My passion lies in transforming creative ideas into real-world applications, leveraging skills in React, Python, and machine learning. 

As a first-generation college student, I draw inspiration from my parentsâ€™ sacrifices, driving my commitment to personal growth and excellence. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in lofi beats or swimming.
