# Hello, I'm Anthony!

I’m an Incoming Software Developer Intern @ Alpine, passionate about AI/ML and full-stack development. I love transforming creative ideas into real-world applications, utilizing my skills in Python, React, and Machine Learning to build impactful projects.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me listening to lofi beats or swimming.
